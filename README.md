This library is a collection of AI algorithms used in games. This includes:
  - Steering behaviors (NYI)
  - Flocking behaviors (NYI)
  - Pathfinding (NYI)


## Steering

The set of steering behaviors used in many modern game engines: [lib-GDX],
[Unity] (also [2]), [ROYGBIV], [Godot]. All these libraries share the same
ancestry: they originate from the work of [Craig Reynolds] originally published
in 1999. This library implements the same algorithms in Dart language.
